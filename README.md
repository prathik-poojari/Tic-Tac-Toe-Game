# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this project is to practice JavaScript for a better understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and to apply theoretical knowledge into practical coding.

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game interface is designed to be responsive, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid to place their marks (either 'X' or 'O').
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won by forming a line of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Draw Detection**: If all spaces are filled without any player winning, the game declares a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game at any time to start a new round.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS**: Styles the HTML elements to create an attractive game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including player turns, win detection, and user interactions.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Start playing by clicking on the grid spaces to place your marks ('X' or 'O').
4. The game will automatically detect when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
5. Use the "Reset" button to start a new game at any time.
